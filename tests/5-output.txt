Notes:

⦁ You always cut at *message boundaries*\.
⦁ `summarize\_single\_long\_message\_with\_llm` is just a one‑off “summarize this text” call\.

*📚 3\.2\. Step 2 – Summarize Each Chunk with the LLM*

For each chunk, call the LLM with a strict summarization prompt\.

*🔖 Prompt template \(per chunk, copy‑paste\):*

**>You are summarizing a segment of a long conversation between a user and an assistant\.
>
>Your goal is to produce a short but highly informative summary that can replace the raw messages in future prompts\.
>
>*INCLUDE \(only if present and important\):*
>⦁ Main user questions, tasks, and goals in this segment
>⦁ Important facts, constraints, and preferences the user states \(deadlines, environment, skill level, likes/dislikes, etc\.\)
>⦁ Key explanations, designs, solution ideas, and reasoning from the assistant \(described concisely in words; avoid large code blocks\)
>⦁ Any decisions made, final answers given, or conclusions reached
>⦁ Any explicit open questions or TODO items mentioned||
